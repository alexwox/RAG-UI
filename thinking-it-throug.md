# AW:
I want to build a library that uses an agent based system with LLAMAINDEX to create a new form of user interface. 

The interface is meant to: 
- Take in a broad task, question (we will call it "a mission statement")
- Estimate what type of context it will need to complete the mission.
- Generate a path of questions to the user or a "tree". This "tree" should be structured, so it can be displayed, manipulated etc. Maybe in JSON? The questions should be Mutually Exclusive and Completley Exhaustive (MECE). To efficiently fill the context window.  
- Each Question should have a setting called a "mode" of answering. The simplest being a "Multichoice with 4 answers". The answers should be generated by an LLM agent to elicit as much information as possible. 
- After an answer is provided by the user, it should be saved into the tree, and the "context evaluator agent" should now evaluate if enough context is provided, or if "tree" space needs to be further explored. 
- The system continiously promts the user with more and more questions until the "context evaluator agent" decides enough context has been provided to successfully complete the mission. 

Does this make sense? The idea is allow users of LLMs to provide context in a gamified way, without having to 
1. Think of all important topics of contex the LLM might need
2. Explicitly write out the context

Whats your thoughts?


# O1 Preview: 
Yes, your idea makes sense and is quite innovative. You’re proposing a system that transforms the way users interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) by guiding them through a structured, gamified process to provide context. By leveraging an agent-based system with LLAMAINDEX, the interface would dynamically generate a “tree” of questions that are Mutually Exclusive and Completely Exhaustive (MECE). This approach aims to efficiently gather all necessary information without overwhelming the user.

Thoughts and Considerations:

	1.	Enhanced User Experience:
	•	Gamification: By turning the context-gathering process into a game-like experience, users are more likely to engage and provide richer information.
	•	Simplification: Users don’t need to brainstorm all possible context elements; the system intelligently probes for necessary details.
	2.	Efficient Context Gathering:
	•	MECE Framework: Ensures that the questions cover all possible areas without overlap, making the process efficient.
	•	Dynamic Questioning: The system adapts based on previous answers, asking only relevant follow-up questions.
	3.	Technical Feasibility:
	•	LLAMAINDEX Integration: Utilizing LLAMAINDEX can help manage and retrieve context effectively.
	•	JSON Structure: Representing the question tree in JSON allows for easy manipulation, visualization, and integration with other systems.
	4.	Challenges to Address:
	•	Question Generation: Crafting MECE questions automatically is complex. Ensuring that the LLM generates mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive options may require advanced prompt engineering or additional algorithms.
	•	Context Evaluation: Determining when enough context has been gathered is non-trivial. You might need a threshold or a confidence score to decide when to proceed.
	•	User Fatigue: While gamification helps, too many questions might lead to user fatigue. Balancing depth of context with user engagement is key.
	5.	Modes of Answering:
	•	Multiple Choice Limitation: While multiple-choice questions are easy to answer, they might limit the depth of information. Consider incorporating other modes like sliders, ranking, or even open-ended responses where appropriate.
	•	Adaptive Responses: The system could adjust the mode of answering based on the type of information needed.
	6.	Privacy and Ethical Considerations:
	•	Data Handling: Ensure that the user’s inputs are securely stored and handled, especially if sensitive information is involved.
	•	Transparency: Be clear with users about how their information will be used by the system.

Potential Benefits:

	•	Improved Outputs: With better context, the LLM can generate more accurate and relevant responses.
	•	User Empowerment: Users feel more in control of the interaction, potentially increasing satisfaction and trust in the system.
	•	Scalability: Such a system could be adapted for various applications, from customer service bots to personalized learning platforms.

Final Thoughts:

Your proposed system has the potential to significantly enhance user interactions with LLMs by making the context provision more intuitive and engaging. By addressing the challenges and carefully designing the user experience, you could create a powerful tool that benefits both users and developers working with AI systems.

If you proceed with this project, it might be helpful to start with a prototype focusing on a specific application area. This would allow you to test the concept, gather user feedback, and make iterative improvements.
